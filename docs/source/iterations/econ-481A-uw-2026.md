## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is grading distributed in this course?**

The course grade is based entirely on your [final project](https://eisenhauerio.github.io/courses-business-decisions/course-projects/index.html). This course is an opportunity to explore the exciting space of data science - what you get out of it depends entirely on the effort and creativity you put into your project work throughout the quarter. I am always available to point you towards exciting areas to explore and will continuously share material in our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/eisenhauerioworkspace/shared_invite/zt-3lxtc370j-XLdokfTkno54wfhHVxvEfA), but the responsibility for making the most of this opportunity is yours.

**When is the project due?** The project is due at 11:59 PM PDT on March 20th. You will lose access to your student repo immediately after the deadline.
