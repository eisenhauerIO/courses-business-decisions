# ECON 481A — Data Science for Economists — University of Washington (2026)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does grading work?** Your course grade is based entirely on your [final project](https://eisenhauerio.github.io/courses-business-decisions/course-projects/index.html) - there are no exams, homework assignments, or other submissions. This course offers an opportunity to explore the field of data science, and what you gain from it depends on the effort and creativity you invest in your project throughout the quarter. I am always available to guide you toward interesting areas and will regularly share resources in our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/eisenhauerioworkspace/shared_invite/zt-3lxtc370j-XLdokfTkno54wfhHVxvEfA), but making the most of this opportunity is your responsibility.

**When is the project due?** The project is due at 11:59 PM PDT on March 20th. You will lose access to your student repo immediately after the deadline.

**What software do I need to install?** The [Build Systems](https://eisenhauerio.github.io/courses-business-decisions/build-systems/index.html) page lists the tools we use throughout the course. Start with the essentials: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). You'll also need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. We'll introduce additional tools as they become relevant—you don't need everything on day one.

**Where can I find the lecture notebooks?** All lecture notebooks are embedded directly in the [course website](https://eisenhauerio.github.io/courses-business-decisions/) under each topic section (Understand Domain, Measure Impact, etc.). To download the source files, click "Edit on GitHub" at the top of any page.
