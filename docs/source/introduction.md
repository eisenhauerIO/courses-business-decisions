# Introduction

Every business decision is a bet made under uncertainty. Impact measurement improves the odds by showing which actions actually move the needle. Better evidence, better bets, better results.

This course teaches two complementary skillsets: *impact measurement*—how to rigorously measure causal effects—and *software development*—how to build code systems that integrate into business workflows. These skills are domain-agnostic and transfer to any context where decisions need evidence and code needs to run.

AI-assisted coding bridges these skillsets. With the right foundations in both, you can move from rigorous analysis to deployed system—something that once required separate specialists—faster than ever before.

Throughout the course, we use the [Impact Engine](https://github.com/eisenhauerIO/tools-impact-engine) and [Online Retail Simulator](https://github.com/eisenhauerIO/tools-catalog-generator) as our running examples, with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) as our AI coding assistant.
