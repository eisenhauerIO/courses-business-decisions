# Allocate Resources

With causal estimates from the [Measure Impact](../measure-impact/index) stage and their credibility assessed in the [Evaluate Evidence](../evaluate-evidence/index) stage, the final step is to decide where to invest under uncertainty. Connecting evidence quality to resource allocation is emerging territory, with methods, software patterns, and best practices still being developed.

Measuring impact and evaluating the quality of that evidence are necessary first steps. The ultimate objective is to use those assessed estimates to guide resource allocation decisions under uncertainty. This section will integrate impact estimates with decision-theoretic and software-based approaches to inform how organizations prioritize, scale, and sequence investments.
