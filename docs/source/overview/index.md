# Course Overview

Businesses face countless decisions with incomplete information. Which initiatives will move the needle? Where should resources go?

Economic thinking provides rigor. First, measure impact—use causal inference to establish what is true. Then, allocate resources—use decision theory to determine what to do. Done well, measurement and allocation create a learning loop: each action produces new evidence, which updates beliefs, which informs the next allocation.

Software engineering enables implementation. You need tools to measure impact reliably. You need tools to allocate resources systematically. Without working systems, the loop remains theoretical—good ideas that never ship.

***Measure Impact.***  What is true? Before allocating resources, you must understand what actually works. This stage teaches causal inference methods—from randomized experiments to observational techniques—that distinguish correlation from causation and establish genuine cause and effect.

***Allocate Resources.***  What should we do? Knowing what works is not enough—you must decide where to invest under constraints and uncertainty. This stage teaches how to allocate resources across initiatives based on measured impact and remaining uncertainty. Better evidence enables better bets.

***Build Systems.***  How do we make this repeatable? Measurement and allocation only matter if they can be executed reliably. This stage teaches software development practices—version control, testing, deployment—that turn methods into durable systems for measurement and decision-making.

***Improve Decisions.*** How does this change outcomes? Evidence, priorities, and systems only matter if they shape real behavior. This stage teaches how to translate insights into decisions that are actually implemented. The goal is not understanding—it is impact.


This course teaches you to build and operate <img src="../_static/learn-decide-repeat.png" alt="LDR" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> ***Learn · Decide · Repeat*** systems. You will learn causal inference, decision theory, software engineering, and implementation strategies that turn analysis into systematically improved decisions.

Throughout the course, we ground these ideas in a single, concrete decision context drawn from large-scale online retail. The problem of improving product data quality at scale provides the domain in which every method, system, and decision is introduced
