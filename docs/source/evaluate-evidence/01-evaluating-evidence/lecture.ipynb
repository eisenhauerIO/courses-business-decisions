    "# Evaluating Causal Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring causal effects is only the first step. Before using an estimate to guide a business decision, we need to ask: **How much should we trust this number?** This lecture develops the conceptual tools for answering that question — from general principles of evidence quality, through diagnostic checks shared across all causal methods, to the method-specific tests that assess each design's identifying assumptions."

    "## 1. Evaluating Evidence in General\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal vs. External Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "Every causal study faces two distinct questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Validity Type | Question | Threats |\n",
    "|---------------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Internal validity** | Is the causal estimate correct *for this study population*? | Selection bias, confounding, measurement error |\n",
    "| **External validity** | Does the estimate generalize *to other populations or settings*? | Sample selection, context dependence, time effects |\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal validity is a prerequisite — an estimate that is wrong for the study population tells us nothing about other settings. But a perfectly valid estimate from a narrow population may not apply elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical vs. Practical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "A result can be statistically significant without being practically meaningful, and vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical significance** asks: Could this result have arisen by chance? (Measured by p-values, confidence intervals)\n",
    "- **Practical significance** asks: Is the effect large enough to matter for the decision? (Measured by effect sizes, cost-benefit analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "With large samples, even trivially small effects become statistically significant. Conversely, small samples may fail to detect genuinely important effects. Decision-makers need both: evidence that the effect is real *and* that it is large enough to justify action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy of Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all research designs provide equally credible evidence. The strength of a causal claim depends on how effectively the design rules out alternative explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tier | Design | Strength |\n",
    "|------|--------|----------|\n",
    "| 1 | Randomized experiments (RCTs) | Random assignment eliminates selection bias by construction |\n",
    "| 2 | Quasi-experimental methods (DiD, RDD, IV) | Exploit natural variation but rely on untestable assumptions |\n",
    "| 3 | Observational methods (matching, regression) | Require strong conditional independence assumptions |\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher tiers are not always feasible. The goal is to use the strongest design available and to be transparent about the assumptions required by weaker designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replication and Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "A single estimate, no matter how well-designed the study, provides limited evidence. Confidence increases when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication**: Different studies, using different data and methods, reach similar conclusions\n",
    "- **Robustness**: The estimate remains stable across reasonable changes in specification, sample, or assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to minor analytical choices — such as which covariates to include or how to define the outcome — signals fragility in the evidence."

    "## 2. Diagnostics Shared Across Causal Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the specific causal method, several diagnostic tools apply broadly. These checks assess whether the core assumptions of the design are plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariate Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal methods that condition on observables (matching, subclassification, regression) rely on treated and control groups being comparable. **Covariate balance** measures how similar the groups are on pre-treatment characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard metric is the **standardized mean difference (SMD)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{SMD}_k = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{k,\\text{treated}} - \\bar{X}_{k,\\text{control}}}{\\sqrt{(s_{k,\\text{treated}}^2 + s_{k,\\text{control}}^2) / 2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A common threshold is $|\\text{SMD}| < 0.1$, though this is a guideline, not a rule. **Love plots** display SMDs for all covariates before and after adjustment, making it easy to assess whether a method has improved balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "We used Love plots in the matching and subclassification lecture to assess balance improvement. The evaluate tool checks covariate balance as part of its automated review.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Placebo Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Placebo tests** apply the causal method in settings where we know the true effect is zero. If the method detects a \"significant\" effect where none exists, something is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common placebo tests include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Placebo outcomes** | Apply the method to outcomes that should not be affected by treatment | Treatment is a marketing campaign; placebo outcome is warehouse temperature |\n",
    "| **Placebo treatments** | Assign treatment at a time or threshold where no real treatment occurred | In a DiD design, test for a \"treatment effect\" two periods before the actual intervention |\n",
    "| **Placebo units** | Apply the method to units that were not actually treated | In synthetic control, run the method on a control unit and check if a gap appears |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Every causal method relies on assumptions that cannot be fully tested with the data. **Sensitivity analysis** asks: How much would the assumptions need to be violated to overturn the conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rosenbaum bounds**: For matching estimators, quantify how large an unobserved confounder would need to be to explain away the effect\n",
    "- **Coefficient stability**: If adding additional covariates substantially changes the estimate, the conditional independence assumption may be fragile\n",
    "- **Omitted variable bias bounds**: Formal frameworks (e.g., Oster 2019) bound the bias from unobserved confounders based on the explanatory power of observed ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Support / Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that compare treated and control units require that both groups exist across the relevant range of covariates. **Common support** (or **overlap**) means that for any covariate value, there is a positive probability of being in either group:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 < P(D=1 \\mid X=x) < 1 \\quad \\text{for all } x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Violations of common support mean the method is extrapolating rather than comparing like with like. Diagnostics include propensity score histograms and trimming rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-treatment Outcome Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "For methods that use time-series variation (difference-in-differences, synthetic control), **parallel pre-treatment trends** between treated and control units support the identifying assumption. If outcomes diverge before treatment, the estimated effect may reflect pre-existing differences rather than the intervention."
