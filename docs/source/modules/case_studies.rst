3. Partner with European distributor
4. Delay entry and focus on North American growth

**Key Factors**:
* Market size: €200M potential market
* Competition: 5 established players with 60% market share
* Investment required: $10M (acquisition), $3M (organic), $500K (partnership)
* Timeline to profitability: 3 years (acquisition), 5 years (organic), 2 years (partnership)
* Risk of failure: 30% (acquisition), 40% (organic), 50% (partnership)

Analysis Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**SWOT Analysis**:

*Strengths*:
* Superior technology
* Strong customer satisfaction in North America
* Solid financial position

*Weaknesses*:

**Decision Tree Analysis**:

Acquisition Path:
* Investment: $10M
* Success (70%): $8M annual profit = $56M NPV over 10 years
* Failure (30%): -$5M loss
* Expected Value: 0.70 × $56M + 0.30 × (-$5M) = $37.7M

Organic Growth Path:
* Investment: $3M
* Success (60%): $5M annual profit = $35M NPV over 10 years
* Failure (40%): -$2M loss
* Expected Value: 0.60 × $35M + 0.40 × (-$2M) = $20.2M

Partnership Path:
* Investment: $500K
* Success (50%): $3M annual profit = $21M NPV over 10 years
* Failure (50%): -$300K loss
* Expected Value: 0.50 × $21M + 0.50 × (-$300K) = $10.35M

Decision Outcome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TechCorp's Decision**: Pursue partnership path initially, with option to acquire partner or switch to organic growth after 2 years.

**Rationale**:
* Lower initial risk and investment
* Gain European market knowledge
* Preserve financial flexibility

Case Study 2: Product Development Under Uncertainty
----------------------------------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

AutoParts Inc., a $100M automotive components manufacturer, must decide whether to invest in developing electric vehicle (EV) components. The EV market is growing but uncertain.

Decision Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Investment Required**: $20M over 3 years

**Market Scenarios**:
* **Rapid EV adoption** (30% probability): $50M annual revenue by year 5
* **Moderate EV adoption** (50% probability): $20M annual revenue by year 5
* **Slow EV adoption** (20% probability): $5M annual revenue by year 5

**Alternative**: Continue focus on traditional components
* Stable market but declining 5% annually
* Current revenue: $40M from traditional components

Analysis Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Scenario Analysis with NPV** (10% discount rate):

Rapid Adoption Scenario:
* NPV = -$20M (investment) + PV($50M revenue stream) = $58M

Moderate Adoption Scenario:
* NPV = -$20M + PV($20M revenue stream) = $12M

Slow Adoption Scenario:
* NPV = -$20M + PV($5M revenue stream) = -$8M

**Expected Value**:
EV = 0.30 × $58M + 0.50 × $12M + 0.20 × (-$8M) = $23.8M

**Traditional Components NPV**:
Declining revenue stream: $15M NPV

**Risk Considerations**:
* High uncertainty in market adoption
* Significant upfront investment
* Cannibalization of existing products
* Competitive positioning risk if delay

Decision-Making Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Management Debate**:

Case Study 3: Operational Decision - Outsourcing
-------------------------------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

RetailCo, a $500M retail chain, is evaluating whether to outsource its IT operations to a specialized service provider.

Decision Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Current State**:
* IT department: 50 employees
* Annual IT cost: $12M
* Service quality: Good but not excellent
* Innovation: Limited due to resource constraints

**Outsourcing Proposal**:
* Provider offers same services for $9M annually (5-year contract)
* Promises improved service levels
* Requires termination of 45 employees (5 retained for vendor management)
* Transition costs: $2M

**Stakeholder Perspectives**:
* **IT Director**: Concerned about job losses, service quality risk
* **CFO**: Focused on cost savings ($3M annually)
* **COO**: Wants better technology innovation
* **HR**: Worried about employee morale and severance costs
* **Store Managers**: Need reliable systems, skeptical of change

Analysis Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Quantitative Analysis**:

Cost-Benefit Over 5 Years:
* Cost savings: $3M × 5 years = $15M
* Transition costs: -$2M
* Severance costs: -$1.5M
* Retained employee costs: +$1M annually = +$5M
* Net benefit: $15M - $2M - $1.5M - $5M = $6.5M

**Qualitative Risk Assessment**:

High Risks:
* Loss of institutional knowledge
* Service disruption during transition
* Vendor dependency and lock-in
* Hidden costs and scope creep
* Employee morale impact

Medium Risks:
* Reduced responsiveness to business needs
* Security and data privacy concerns
* Contract management complexity

**Alternative Options**:
1. Full outsourcing (as proposed)
2. Selective outsourcing (infrastructure only, keep applications in-house)
3. Shared services model (internal service optimization)
4. Status quo with efficiency improvements

Decision-Making Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Vroom-Yetton Analysis**:
* Decision quality important: Yes
* Sufficient information: No (need more vendor due diligence)
* Problem structured: Partially
* Team acceptance important: Yes (affects morale and operations)
* Team alignment: No (significant resistance)

**Recommendation**: Consultative II (CII) - Share problem with team, get input, then decide

**Additional Due Diligence**:
* Site visits to vendor's other clients
* Reference checks with current customers
* Detailed review of SLA (Service Level Agreement)
* Legal review of contract terms
* Pilot test with non-critical systems

Decision Outcome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**RetailCo's Decision**: Selective outsourcing approach
* Outsource infrastructure and help desk: $5M contract
* Keep application development and strategic IT in-house: 20 employees
* Invest $1M in automation and tools
* Redeploy 15 employees to other roles; 15 voluntary separations

**Rationale**:
* Achieves 50% of cost savings with lower risk
* Retains strategic capabilities and knowledge
* Maintains employee morale through redeployment
* Keeps flexibility for future changes
* Tests vendor relationship on lower-risk functions

**Results** (3 years later):
* Cost savings of $2M annually achieved
* Service quality improved in outsourced areas
* Retained team driving innovation in applications
* No major service disruptions
* Strong vendor relationship established
* Company later expanded outsourcing to other areas

Key Lessons
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Stakeholder management**: Addressing concerns improved decision quality
2. **Pilot approach**: Testing with lower-risk areas reduced implementation risk
3. **Human factors**: Considering employee impact led to better outcomes
4. **Strategic vs. operational**: Retaining strategic capabilities was valuable
5. **Incremental change**: Gradual approach more successful than big bang

Case Study 4: Crisis Decision - Product Recall
-----------------------------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

FoodCorp, a $200M food manufacturer, discovers that a batch of its popular snack product may be contaminated. Initial tests are inconclusive, and no illnesses have been reported yet.

Decision Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Known Facts**:
* One batch (50,000 units) potentially affected
* Products distributed across 500 stores
* Laboratory tests show possible contamination
* Confirmation testing requires 48 hours
* Product shelf life: 90 days; 30 days until expiration

**Decision Options**:
1. **Immediate voluntary recall**: Recall entire batch now
2. **Targeted recall**: Recall only from high-risk locations
3. **Wait for confirmation**: Hold decision until definitive test results
4. **Enhanced monitoring**: Increase surveillance, recall if illness reported

**Time Pressure**: Media has contacted company; story may break within 24 hours

Analysis Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision Criteria**:
* Consumer safety (paramount)
* Brand reputation
* Financial impact
* Regulatory compliance
* Legal liability
* Speed of response

**Cost Analysis**:

Immediate Full Recall:
* Direct costs: $500K (product, logistics, disposal)
* Revenue loss: $1M (product + short-term sales impact)
* PR costs: $200K
* Total: $1.7M

Wait for Confirmation:

* If negative result: No recall needed ($0)
* If positive result:

  * Same costs as immediate recall: $1.7M
  * Additional reputation damage: $2-5M
  * Potential illness costs: $5-20M
  * Regulatory penalties: $500K-2M

Expected Value (Assuming 40% probability of contamination):
* Immediate recall: -$1.7M (certain)
* Wait: 0.60 × $0 + 0.40 × (-$10M average) = -$4M expected

**Reputational Risk Analysis**:
* Proactive recall: Demonstrates responsibility, likely praise
* Reactive recall after illnesses: Severe reputation damage, loss of trust
* Recent examples show proactive companies recover faster

Decision-Making Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Crisis Team Meeting** (2 hours after discovery):
* **CEO**: "What's the right thing to do?"
* **Legal**: Recommends recall to limit liability
* **Operations**: Can execute recall within 24 hours
* **Marketing**: Proactive recall better for brand
* **Finance**: Concerned about costs but understands risk
* **Quality**: Errs on side of caution

**Six Thinking Hats Exercise**:
* White (Facts): Inconclusive tests, no illnesses yet
* Red (Feelings): Anxiety, urgency, responsibility for consumers
* Black (Risks): Potential harm to consumers, reputation damage, lawsuits
* Yellow (Benefits): Proactive action protects consumers and brand
* Green (Alternatives): Could do targeted recall or enhanced monitoring
* Blue (Process): Need quick decision but thoughtful approach

Decision Outcome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**FoodCorp's Decision**: Immediate voluntary recall of entire batch

**Public Statement**: "Out of an abundance of caution for consumer safety, we are voluntarily recalling [product]. While testing is ongoing, consumer safety is our top priority."

**Implementation**:
* 24-hour recall execution plan activated
* Consumer hotline established
* Full refunds offered
* Daily updates to media and regulators
* Root cause investigation launched

**Results**:
* All products recalled within 48 hours
* Confirmation tests came back positive (contamination confirmed)
* Zero illnesses reported
* Positive media coverage of responsible action
* Consumer trust maintained
* Sales recovered to normal levels within 3 months
* Enhanced quality controls implemented

Key Lessons
~~~~~~~~~~~
