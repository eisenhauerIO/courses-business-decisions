Decision-Making Frameworks
==========================

This module explores various frameworks and methodologies that provide structured approaches to business decision-making. These frameworks help ensure consistency, thoroughness, and quality in the decision process.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Apply multiple decision-making frameworks to business problems
* Select appropriate frameworks for different decision contexts
* Understand the strengths and limitations of each approach
* Integrate frameworks with organizational decision processes

Rational Decision-Making Model
-------------------------------

The rational decision-making model is a systematic approach that emphasizes logic and objective analysis.

Key Steps
~~~~~~~~~

1. Define the problem clearly
2. Identify decision criteria
3. Weight the criteria based on importance
4. Generate alternatives
5. Evaluate alternatives against criteria
6. Select the best alternative
7. Implement and monitor

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

* Structured and systematic
* Reduces bias and emotion
* Transparent and defensible
* Works well for complex decisions

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Time-consuming
* Assumes perfect information
* May oversimplify complex realities
* Can be too rigid for fast-moving situations

SWOT Analysis
-------------

SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a strategic planning framework used to evaluate internal and external factors.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

**Strengths** (Internal, Positive)
  * What does the organization do well?
  * What unique resources or capabilities exist?
  * What advantages over competitors?

**Weaknesses** (Internal, Negative)
  * What could be improved?
  * What resources are lacking?
  * Where are competitors stronger?

**Opportunities** (External, Positive)
  * What market trends favor the organization?
  * What unmet customer needs exist?
  * What partnerships could be formed?

**Threats** (External, Negative)
  * What competitive pressures exist?
  * What regulatory changes loom?
  * What market shifts could harm the business?

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

SWOT analysis is particularly useful for:

* Strategic planning
* Market entry decisions
* Product development
* Competitive positioning

Decision Trees
--------------

Decision trees are graphical tools that map out decision paths and their potential outcomes, including probabilities and payoffs.

Structure
~~~~~~~~~

* **Decision nodes** (squares): Points where choices are made
* **Chance nodes** (circles): Points where uncertain events occur
* **End nodes** (triangles): Final outcomes with associated values
* **Branches**: Paths representing choices or chance events

Expected Value Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For decisions under uncertainty, decision trees help calculate expected values:

.. math::

   EV = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \times V_i

Where:
* :math:`EV` = Expected Value
* :math:`P_i` = Probability of outcome i
* :math:`V_i` = Value of outcome i

Example
~~~~~~~

A company must decide whether to launch a new product:

* Launch cost: $100,000
* High success (30% probability): Revenue $500,000
* Medium success (50% probability): Revenue $200,000
* Low success (20% probability): Revenue $50,000

Expected Revenue = (0.30 × $500,000) + (0.50 × $200,000) + (0.20 × $50,000) = $260,000
Expected Profit = $260,000 - $100,000 = $160,000

Cost-Benefit Analysis
---------------------

Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach to evaluating the economic pros and cons of a decision.

Process
~~~~~~~

1. **Identify costs**: Direct, indirect, opportunity, and intangible costs
2. **Identify benefits**: Direct, indirect, and intangible benefits
3. **Quantify**: Convert costs and benefits to monetary values
4. **Time adjust**: Apply discounting for future cash flows
5. **Compare**: Calculate net benefit or benefit-cost ratio
6. **Decide**: Select options with positive net benefits

Net Present Value (NPV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::

   NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}

Where:
* :math:`CF_t` = Cash flow at time t
* :math:`r` = Discount rate
* :math:`n` = Number of periods

The Vroom-Yetton Decision Model
--------------------------------

This model helps leaders determine the appropriate level of participation in decision-making.

Decision Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Autocratic I (AI)**: Leader decides alone with available information
* **Autocratic II (AII)**: Leader obtains information from team, then decides alone
* **Consultative I (CI)**: Leader shares problem individually with team members, then decides
* **Consultative II (CII)**: Leader shares problem with team as a group, then decides
* **Group-based (GII)**: Leader facilitates group discussion; team decides together

Selection Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model uses a decision tree based on questions about:

* Quality requirements
* Information availability
* Problem structure
* Team acceptance importance
* Team alignment with goals

Six Thinking Hats
-----------------

Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats is a parallel thinking method that promotes comprehensive perspective-taking.

The Six Hats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **White Hat**: Facts, figures, and objective information
* **Red Hat**: Emotions, feelings, and intuitions
* **Black Hat**: Caution, risks, and potential problems
* **Yellow Hat**: Benefits, optimism, and positive aspects
* **Green Hat**: Creativity, alternatives, and new ideas
* **Blue Hat**: Process control, organization, and next steps

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Teams can use this method to:

* Explore decisions from multiple angles
* Reduce conflict by separating thinking modes
* Ensure comprehensive analysis
* Generate creative solutions

Choosing the Right Framework
-----------------------------

Different frameworks work best in different contexts:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Framework
     - Best For
     - Key Consideration
   * - Rational Model
     - Complex, high-stakes decisions
     - Requires time and information
   * - SWOT
     - Strategic planning
     - Needs honest internal assessment
   * - Decision Trees
     - Decisions with uncertainty
     - Requires probability estimates
   * - Cost-Benefit
     - Investment decisions
     - Needs quantification of benefits
   * - Vroom-Yetton
     - Leadership decisions
     - Considers team dynamics
   * - Six Hats
     - Creative problem-solving
     - Works best in groups

Summary
-------

Decision-making frameworks provide structure and rigor to the decision process. By selecting and applying appropriate frameworks, decision-makers can improve the quality and consistency of their choices.

Exercises
---------

1. Select a recent strategic decision in your organization. Conduct a SWOT analysis for this decision.
2. Create a decision tree for a choice you're currently facing that involves uncertainty.
3. Calculate the NPV for an investment opportunity using a 10% discount rate.
4. Use the Six Thinking Hats method to analyze a current business challenge.

Case Study: Framework Application
----------------------------------

**Scenario**: A retail company is considering whether to open a new store location.

**Framework Selection**: Decision tree combined with cost-benefit analysis would be appropriate because:

* The decision involves significant investment (cost-benefit)
* Multiple uncertain outcomes exist (decision tree)
* Quantitative analysis is possible

**Analysis Steps**:

1. Map decision tree with branches for different scenarios
2. Estimate probabilities for market conditions
3. Calculate expected values for each path
4. Perform NPV analysis on expected cash flows
5. Make go/no-go decision based on positive NPV
