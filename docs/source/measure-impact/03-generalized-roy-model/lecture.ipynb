Interpretation\n\n### What We Observe\n\n| Component | Value | Interpretation |\n|-----------|-------|----------------|\n| **Baseline Bias** | Positive | High-quality products have higher $Y_0$ (they sell more even without treatment) |\n| **Selection on Gains** | Negative | High-quality products have smaller $\\delta$ (less room for improvement) |\n| **Net Effect** | Depends | The two bias components partially offset each other |\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **ATE ≠ ATT ≠ ATC**: Under essential heterogeneity, these parameters diverge\n\n2. **Naive comparisons are biased**: Simply comparing treated vs. control conflates the true effect with selection\n\n3. **Understanding selection matters**: The MTE framework reveals how effects vary with selection propensity\n\n4. **Policy implications**: \n   - If we expand treatment, we treat products with higher marginal effects (ATC > ATT)\n   - The naive estimate doesn't tell us what to expect from policy changes"

    "This lecture demonstrated **essential heterogeneity** using an e-commerce content optimization example:\n",

    "### Theory\n",
    "- Treatment effects vary across individuals (heterogeneity)\n",
    "- Selection into treatment correlates with treatment response (essential heterogeneity)\n",
    "- This causes ATE, ATT, and ATC to diverge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application\n",
    "- High-quality products are selected for content optimization\n",
    "- But high-quality products benefit LESS from optimization (diminishing returns)\n",
    "- This creates negative selection on gains: ATT < ATE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias Decomposition\n",
    "- **Baseline bias** (positive): Treated products have higher baseline outcomes\n",
    "- **Selection on gains** (negative): Treated products have smaller treatment effects\n",
    "- These partially offset, but the naive estimate still doesn't equal the ATE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "Understanding essential heterogeneity is crucial for:\n",
    "- Correctly interpreting treatment effect estimates\n",
    "- Predicting effects of policy changes (expanding or restricting treatment)\n",
    "- Designing optimal targeting strategies"
