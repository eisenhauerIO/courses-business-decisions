    "This notebook demonstrates the current capabilities of the *grmpy* package. *grmpy* is an open source package for the programming language python that enables researchers to simulate datasets andestimate parameters using already existing data within the structure of the generalized Roy model. Currently the package serves as a teaching tool for a course on the econometrics of policy evaluation at the University of Bonn. The corresponding lecture materials can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/econometrics).  Morover it is thought of as a promotion for the conceptual framework as well as a showcase for basic software engineering practices.\n",
