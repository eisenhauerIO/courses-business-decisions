    "## The Potential Outcome Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential outcome framework, also known as the **Rubin Causal Model (RCM)**, provides a precise mathematical language for defining causal effects. The framework was developed by Donald Rubin in the 1970s, building on earlier work by Jerzy Neyman.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "For each unit $i$ in a population, we define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $D_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$: **Treatment indicator** (1 if unit receives treatment, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- $Y_i^1$: **Potential outcome under treatment** — the outcome unit $i$ *would have* if treated\n",
    "- $Y_i^0$: **Potential outcome under control** — the outcome unit $i$ *would have* if not treated\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that both potential outcomes exist conceptually for every unit, but we can only observe one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Switching Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **observed outcome** follows the switching equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = D_i \\cdot Y_i^1 + (1 - D_i) \\cdot Y_i^0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation formalizes which potential outcome we observe:\n",
    "- If $D_i = 1$ (treated): we observe $Y_i = Y_i^1$\n",
    "- If $D_i = 0$ (control): we observe $Y_i = Y_i^0$"
