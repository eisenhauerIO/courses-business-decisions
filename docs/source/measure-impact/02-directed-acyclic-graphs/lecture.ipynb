    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DAGs encode causal assumptions visually**: They make your causal model explicit and help identify sources of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backdoor paths create spurious correlations**: When a confounder affects both treatment and outcome, naive estimates are biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The backdoor criterion tells us what to condition on**: Block all backdoor paths while leaving direct paths open.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Not all controls are good controls**: Conditioning on colliders OPENS paths and creates bias—the opposite of what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"Controlling for everything\" is dangerous**: You need to understand the causal structure before adding controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Lecture 01\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection bias we saw in the potential outcomes framework can be represented graphically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection bias** = Open backdoor path\n",
    "- **Randomization** = Severs all backdoor paths (makes D independent of confounders)\n",
    "\n",
    "DAGs and potential outcomes are complementary frameworks for the same underlying problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining lectures cover methods for closing backdoor paths when we can't randomize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matching & Propensity Scores**: Create comparable groups by conditioning on observables\n",
    "- **Regression Discontinuity**: Exploit sharp cutoffs that create local randomization\n",
    "- **Instrumental Variables**: Use exogenous variation that only affects outcome through treatment\n",
    "- **Difference-in-Differences**: Leverage parallel trends assumption"
