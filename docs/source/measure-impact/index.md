## Foundations

### Potential Outcomes Model
We introduce the potential outcome model as the foundational framework for causal inference. We discuss the fundamental problem of causal inference and the role of randomization.

### Causal Graphs (DAGs)
We explore directed acyclic graphs as a tool for representing causal relationships. We discuss how DAGs help identify confounders, mediators, and colliders.

### Generalized Roy Model
We present the generalized Roy model as a unifying framework for understanding selection problems in causal inference.

## Selection on Observables

### Matching & Propensity Scores
We discuss methods for causal inference when selection into treatment depends only on observed covariates. We cover matching estimators and propensity score methods.

```

### ML for Causal Inference
We explore how machine learning methods can improve causal inference, including LASSO for covariate selection and double machine learning.

### Pooled OLS
We discuss pooled OLS estimation with panel data and its assumptions for causal inference.

## Selection on Unobservables

### Instrumental Variables
We introduce instrumental variables as a method for causal inference when unobserved confounding is present.

```{todo}
Add notebook link
```

### Regression Discontinuity
We discuss regression discontinuity designs that exploit sharp or fuzzy cutoffs in treatment assignment.

```{todo}
Add notebook link
```

### Difference-in-Differences
We present difference-in-differences methods for panel data, including the parallel trends assumption and recent advances.

```{todo}

```

### Synthetic Control
We discuss synthetic control methods for comparative case studies with panel data.
